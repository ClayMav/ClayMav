### I'm Clay

I'm a **user-obsessed** full-stack developer building the future of geo-spatial data analytics in the cloud at [wherobots.com](wherobots.com). I am also the co-founder of Bloomin' Labs, the makers of the soon-to-release dedicated game-server host [stratos.host](stratos.host)!

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claymav/), and that's about it!
